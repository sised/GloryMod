Glory mod adds a new difficulty mode, Menace mode, which can be activated through config.
Changing the config will force a reload, going out of your way not to reload will cause the game to not function properly.
Menace mode makes the game SUPER MEGA hard, not kidding, its really hard
bosses  have new sprites, names, COMPLETELY new mechanics and uuh

There's also a few new items, like, weapons, accessories materials and stuff
so that's cool

Menace bosses which are done so far:
King slime
Eye of cthulhu
Eater of Worlds
Brain of Cthulhu
Queen Bee
Skeletron
Wall of Flesh
Destroyer

The rest will be added in future versions

oh and also
it only works in expert mode.

k, that's all i think, have fun
