Glory mod replaces vanilla bosses with way harder modded ones, these bosses will challenge your motivation play them, and beating them is multiple times more rewarding due to their difficulty.
They have unique AI and attacks, and in general have a lot more depth than the vanilla counterpart has.

Not all bosses will be replaced, an explanation on why exists on my discord server which you can join by clicking the "homepage" button.

It also adds some items you can use.

Have fun, good luck.
